Web application to control the status of each machine in the industrial park.<br>
--
The project consists of two parts: a Web Application and an API.<br>

Technologies used: node, express, body parser, ejs, sequelize, slugify, tinymce, bootstrap, html and css.
Two CRUDs were made, one for 'machines' and one for 'status', which I call 'events' in the code. Each machine has a report that can be accessed through the home page or filtering the results by 'status codes' in the home navbar.<br>

This can be found in the 'status updates' link and has been imported into the node modules of this application.
API code link: https://github.com/Caroline-Thais/apiIndustriaAbc which was made to simulate sending data from machines to the web application.
The API would be controlled by workers who have direct access to the machines. Through the API, these employees can control the machines, registering, editing and
updating their status and, when saving the data, the employees who stay in the office would have access to this information through the web application. The API was built
using the Rest architecture and for its consumption Axios was used. <br>
